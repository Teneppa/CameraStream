# CameraStream
This is a demonstration that streams the image from smartglasses to a pc, does the hand recognition on the remote pc and streams the processed image back to the smartglasses.

What the files do:
* [PC] cameraStream.py - Sends the videostream from the camera to the remote computer
* [SG] basic_stream.py - Does the hand recognition in the remote computer and streams it back
* [SG] rec.py - This displays the processed image on the smart glasses

Note:
* [PC] = Run this on the remote computer
* [SG] = Run this on the smartglasses
